"# Perceptron" 

This project included a data folder which contains data in text files.

There are a IPYNB File and a Python File, named CSE353_Perceptron_Code. 
They both contain the same code. The code imported import numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and random libraries.

I would recommand open the IPYNB file using Jupyter NoteBook.

The CSE353_Assignment3_Perceptron_Report.pdf file is my report for this assignment.
